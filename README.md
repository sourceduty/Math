Mathematics is a fundamental discipline that underpins many aspects of our daily lives and scientific understanding. It provides the language and tools necessary for analyzing patterns, solving problems, and understanding the structure of the world around us. From the simple arithmetic that allows us to manage finances to the complex calculus that models the changing conditions of our environment, mathematics is a versatile and essential field. Its applications extend far beyond pure theory, influencing technology, engineering, economics, and even social sciences.

The beauty of mathematics lies in its logical structure and the precision it offers. Mathematical principles are based on proofs and rigorous reasoning, making it a highly reliable and consistent field of study. This logical foundation allows mathematicians to build complex theories from simple axioms, creating a vast and interconnected web of knowledge. Mathematics also fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as it requires one to approach challenges methodically and creatively.

Historically, mathematics has played a crucial role in the advancement of civilizations. Ancient cultures like the Egyptians and Greeks developed early forms of mathematics to address practical needs such as architecture, trade, and astronomy. Over time, mathematics has evolved into a more abstract and sophisticated discipline, leading to groundbreaking discoveries in fields such as physics and computer science.

### Universal Across Languages

Mathematics is widely regarded as one of the easiest subjects to teach across different languages due to its reliance on universal symbols and logical structures. Unlike subjects that depend heavily on linguistic nuances, mathematics uses numbers, formulas, and equations that are universally recognized, regardless of the language spoken. For instance, the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are expressed using the same symbols (+, -, *, /) worldwide, which eliminates the need for translation. This universal language of numbers and operations allows students from diverse linguistic backgrounds to engage with mathematical problems in a similar way, making the teaching process more streamlined and less reliant on verbal explanations.

Furthermore, mathematical concepts and principles are consistent across cultures and education systems. Theorems, such as Pythagoras' theorem or the quadratic formula, remain the same regardless of whether they are taught in English, Mandarin, Arabic, or any other language. This consistency extends to more advanced topics, such as calculus and algebra, where the use of symbols, Greek letters, and logical reasoning remains universally understood. By focusing on these common elements, educators can effectively teach mathematical concepts without the barriers posed by language differences, making mathematics a subject that truly transcends cultural and linguistic boundaries.

### Math Notes & Concepts

<details><summary>Increased Mass-Speed Percentage Formula Concept</summary>
<br>

This concept introduces the idea of modifying the traditional force formula to account for a percentage of speed, which is represented by the term s. In the provided example, the force F is calculated using a mass of 10 kg, an acceleration of 2 m/s², and a speed percentage of 0.5% (converted to the decimal 0.005). The formula calculates the adjusted force considering this speed factor, resulting in a slightly increased force due to the speed percentage.

```
Newton's Mass-Acceleration Force Formula:

F = m * a

Mass-Acceleration Force Formula Legend:

F = force (N)
m = mass of an object (kg)
a = acceleration (m/s²)

Concept Mass-Speed Percentage Formula:

F = m * (1 + s) * a

Concept Mass-Speed Percentage Formula Legend:

F = Force considering Mass-Speed Percentage (N)
m = mass of an object (kg)
a = acceleration (m/s²)
s = speed percentage (as a decimal)

Concept Mass-Speed Percentage Example:

m = 10 kg 
a = 2 m/s²
s = 0.005 (0.5%)

F = 10 kg * (1 + 0.005) * 2 m/s²

    """
    force = mass * (1 + speed_percentage) * acceleration
    return force

# Example usage:
mass = 10  # kg

Expanded Mass-Speed Percentage Formula Concept

Newton's Mass-Acceleration Force Formula:
F = m * a

Mass-Acceleration Force Formula Legend:
F = force (N)
m = mass of an object (kg)
a = acceleration (m/s²)

Expanded Concept Mass-Speed Percentage Formula:
F = m * (1 + s) * a + D

Expanded Concept Mass-Speed Percentage Formula Legend:
F = Force considering Mass-Speed Percentage (N)
m = mass of an object (kg)
a = acceleration (m/s²)
s = speed percentage (as a decimal)
D = drag force (N), which could be proportional to velocity (v)

Drag Force Formula:
D = k * v²

Drag Force Formula Legend:
D = drag force (N)
k = drag coefficient (depends on the medium and shape of the object)
v = velocity (m/s)

Generalized Formula for Different Motions:
F = m * (1 + s) * a + k * v²

Generalized Formula Legend:
F = Total force (N)
m = mass of an object (kg)
a = acceleration (m/s²)
s = speed percentage (as a decimal)
k = drag coefficient
v = velocity (m/s)

Expanded Concept Example:

Given:
m = 10 kg 
a = 2 m/s²
s = 0.005 (0.5%)
v = 3 m/s
k = 0.1 N⋅s²/m²

Calculate drag force:
D = k * v²
D = 0.1 * (3 m/s)²
D = 0.9 N

Calculate force considering Mass-Speed Percentage and drag:
F = m * (1 + s) * a + D
F = 10 kg * (1 + 0.005) * 2 m/s² + 0.9 N
F = 10 kg * 1.005 * 2 m/s² + 0.9 N
F = 20.1 N + 0.9 N
F = 21 N

Force considering Mass-Speed Percentage and Drag = 21 N
```

This expanded formula incorporates the concept of drag force, which is the resistance an object encounters as it moves through a medium such as air or water. Drag force is typically proportional to the square of the object's velocity and is influenced by factors like the shape of the object and the properties of the medium. By introducing a drag force component, represented by the term D = k × v^2, where k is the drag coefficient and v is the velocity, the formula becomes more realistic for scenarios where an object is moving at a significant speed. This adjustment makes the model more applicable to real-world situations, where air resistance or other forms of drag can't be ignored.

The generalized formula, F = m × (1 + s) × a + k × v^2, thus considers not only the basic principles of Newtonian mechanics (mass and acceleration) but also the effects of speed as a percentage and the resistance of the medium through which the object moves. In the provided example, the overall force is calculated by first determining the drag force based on velocity and then combining it with the modified force that accounts for mass and speed percentage. This results in a total force that better reflects the actual forces acting on an object in motion, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics involved.

<details><summary>Bouncy Ball and Wall Calculation</summary>
<br>

This calculation delves into the complex dynamics of a ball bouncing off a surface, incorporating factors such as air drag, spin (Magnus effect), and the angle of approach (inbound pitch). Initially, the ball’s material properties, such as mass and density, are used to calculate its volume and radius. The ball’s cross-sectional area, which plays a crucial role in determining air drag and Magnus effect forces, is also derived. The calculation then breaks down the ball’s initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components based on the inbound pitch angle. The drag force acting on the ball is computed using the drag coefficient, air density, and the ball’s cross-sectional area. This drag force causes a reduction in the ball’s velocity before it impacts the wall, and the adjusted velocity is used in subsequent calculations.

The Magnus effect, resulting from the ball’s spin, introduces an additional force that can alter the ball’s trajectory. After considering the impact of air drag and the Magnus effect, the final speed of the ball after the bounce is calculated using the coefficient of restitution, which reflects the elasticity of the collision. The speed loss, representing the reduction in velocity due to the bounce, is then determined. The calculation further extends to analyze the kinetic energy before and after the collision, highlighting the energy loss during the event. This comprehensive analysis provides insight into how different physical factors—such as air resistance, spin, and collision elasticity—affect the behavior of a bouncing ball, making it a robust model for understanding real-world physics scenarios.

```
Given:
v_i = 10 m/s                 (initial speed before bounce)
e = 0.8                      (coefficient of restitution)
m = 0.5 kg                   (mass of the ball)
ρ_material = 1000 kg/m^3     (density of the ball's material, assuming it's made of rubber)
θ_inbound = 30°              (angle of inbound pitch relative to the horizontal)
ω = 20 rad/s                 (angular velocity or spin rate of the ball)
Cd = 0.47                    (drag coefficient, typical for a spherical object)
ρ_air = 1.225 kg/m^3         (air density at sea level)
A = πr^2                     (cross-sectional area of the ball)

Step 1: Calculate the volume and radius of the ball
- Density (ρ) is mass per unit volume, given by ρ = m / V, where V is the volume.
- The formula for volume is V = m / ρ_material.
  V = 0.5 kg / 1000 kg/m^3
  V = 0.0005 m^3        (volume of the ball)

- The volume of a sphere is given by V = (4/3)πr^3.
- Rearrange to solve for the radius (r):
  r = (3V / 4π)^(1/3)
  r ≈ 0.0482 m         (radius of the ball, approximately 4.82 cm)

Step 2: Calculate the cross-sectional area of the ball
- The cross-sectional area (A) of the ball is:
  A = πr^2
  A = π * (0.0482 m)^2
  A ≈ 0.0073 m^2       (cross-sectional area)

Step 3: Break down the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components
- The initial velocity (v_i) can be broken down using the inbound pitch angle (θ_inbound):
  v_i_horizontal = v_i * cos(θ_inbound)
  v_i_horizontal = 10 m/s * cos(30°)
  v_i_horizontal ≈ 8.66 m/s  (horizontal component of initial speed)

  v_i_vertical = v_i * sin(θ_inbound)
  v_i_vertical = 10 m/s * sin(30°)
  v_i_vertical ≈ 5 m/s       (vertical component of initial speed)

Step 4: Calculate the force of air drag
- The drag force (F_drag) is given by the formula:
  F_drag = 0.5 * Cd * ρ_air * A * v_i^2
- Substituting the values:
  F_drag = 0.5 * 0.47 * 1.225 kg/m^3 * 0.0073 m^2 * (10 m/s)^2
  F_drag ≈ 0.2105 N          (drag force acting on the ball)

Step 5: Calculate the effect of air drag on the velocity
- Air drag will decelerate the ball as it moves towards the wall. Assuming a short duration before impact:
  a_drag = F_drag / m
  a_drag ≈ 0.2105 N / 0.5 kg
  a_drag ≈ 0.421 m/s^2     (acceleration due to drag)

- Calculate the speed reduction due to air drag over a small time interval (Δt):
  Δv_drag = a_drag * Δt
- Assuming a small time interval Δt = 1 s for simplification:
  Δv_drag ≈ 0.421 m/s^2 * 1 s
  Δv_drag ≈ 0.421 m/s      (speed reduction due to air drag)

- Adjust the initial speed considering drag:
  v_i_adjusted = v_i - Δv_drag
  v_i_adjusted ≈ 10 m/s - 0.421 m/s
  v_i_adjusted ≈ 9.579 m/s  (adjusted initial speed)

Step 6: Consider the impact of spin (Magnus effect)
- The Magnus force due to spin can alter the trajectory:
  F_magnus = S * ρ_air * A * v_i * ω
- Assuming a Magnus coefficient S = 0.2 for simplicity:
  F_magnus = 0.2 * 1.225 kg/m^3 * 0.0073 m^2 * 9.579 m/s * 20 rad/s
  F_magnus ≈ 0.3437 N     (Magnus force due to spin)

- The Magnus force adds to the vertical lift or side spin, changing the trajectory slightly. For simplicity, this example focuses on the magnitude, not direction.

Step 7: Calculate the final speed after the bounce
- The final speed (v_f) of the ball after the bounce considering drag and the Magnus effect:
  v_f = e * v_i_adjusted
- Substituting the values:
  v_f = 0.8 * 9.579 m/s
  v_f ≈ 7.663 m/s          (final speed after bounce)

Step 8: Calculate the speed loss
- Speed loss is the difference between the initial speed (adjusted for drag) and the final speed.
  speed_loss = v_i_adjusted - v_f
  speed_loss = 9.579 m/s - 7.663 m/s
  speed_loss ≈ 1.916 m/s   (speed loss after bounce)

Step 9: Analyze the energy lost during the collision
- Kinetic energy before collision (KE_initial):
  KE_initial = 0.5 * m * (v_i_adjusted)^2
  KE_initial ≈ 0.5 * 0.5 kg * (9.579 m/s)^2
  KE_initial ≈ 22.95 Joules

- Kinetic energy after collision (KE_final):
  KE_final = 0.5 * m * (v_f)^2
  KE_final ≈ 0.5 * 0.5 kg * (7.663 m/s)^2
  KE_final ≈ 14.68 Joules

- Energy loss due to the collision:
  energy_loss = KE_initial - KE_final
  energy_loss ≈ 22.95 Joules - 14.68 Joules
  energy_loss ≈ 8.27 Joules   (energy lost due to the collision)

Step 10: Summary of Results
- Initial Speed (v_i): 10 m/s
- Adjusted Initial Speed (v_i_adjusted): 9.579 m/s (considering drag)
- Final Speed (v_f): 7.663 m/s
- Speed Loss: 1.916 m/s
- Initial Kinetic Energy (KE_initial): ≈ 22.95 Joules
- Final Kinetic Energy (KE_final): ≈ 14.68 Joules
- Energy Loss: ≈ 8.27 Joules
- Drag Force (F_drag): ≈ 0.2105 N
- Magnus Force (F_magnus): ≈ 0.3437 N
- Ball Volume (V): 0.0005 m^3
- Ball Radius (r): ≈ 4.82 cm
- Material Density (ρ_material): 1000 kg/m^3
- Cross-sectional Area (A): ≈ 0.0073 m^2

```
1. Task Duration Adjustment Formula

   Adjust the duration of each task based on worker efficiency.

   Formula:

   Adjusted Duration = Base Duration / Worker Efficiency

   Example:

   If the base duration of a task is 5 hours and the worker's efficiency is 1.2,
   Adjusted Duration = 5 hours / 1.2 = 4.17 hours

2. Earliest Start Time (EST) and Earliest Finish Time (EFT)

   Calculate the earliest start and finish times for each task in the DAG.

   Formula:

   EST(task) = max(EFT(predecessor tasks))
   EFT(task) = EST(task) + Adjusted Duration

   Example:

   - If Task A has EFT of 4 hours, and Task B depends on Task A:
   EST(Task B) = EFT(Task A) = 4 hours
   - If Task B takes 3 hours to complete,
   EFT(Task B) = 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours

3. Latest Start Time (LST) and Latest Finish Time (LFT)

   Calculate the latest times a task can start and finish without delaying the overall process.

   Formula:

   LFT(task) = min(LST(successor tasks))
   LST(task) = LFT(task) - Adjusted Duration

   Example:

   - If Task D must finish by hour 20 to not delay subsequent tasks, and it takes 5 hours to complete:
   LFT(Task D) = 20 hours
   LST(Task D) = 20 hours - 5 hours = 15 hours

4. Slack Time Calculation

   Determine the flexibility in scheduling a task without affecting the overall process duration.

   Formula:
   Slack Time = LST(task) - EST(task)
              = LFT(task) - EFT(task)

   Example:

   - If a task has an EST of 7 hours, EFT of 9 hours, LST of 10 hours, and LFT of 12 hours:
   Slack Time = 10 hours - 7 hours = 3 hours
   or
   Slack Time = 12 hours - 9 hours = 3 hours

5. Critical Path Determination

   Identify the sequence of tasks that determines the minimum project duration.

   Steps:

   1. Perform topological sorting on the DAG.
   2. Calculate EST, EFT for each task.
   3. Identify tasks with zero slack time (these are on the critical path).

   Example:

   - If tasks A, B, C, and D form a chain with no slack:
   Critical Path: A → B → C → D

6. Total Process Duration

   Calculate the total duration of the manufacturing process based on the critical path.

   Formula:

   Total Duration = EFT(last task on critical path)

   Example:

   - If the last task on the critical path has an EFT of 45 hours,
   Total Process Duration = 45 hours

7. Error Handling and Rescheduling

   Adjust the process in case of errors like mechanical failures, worker errors, or supply issues.

   Steps:

   - For mechanical failures: Halt the process, fix the issue, and recalculate task durations.
   - For worker errors: Retry the task or assign a different worker.
   - For supply issues: Introduce delay and reschedule dependent tasks.

   Example:

   - If a mechanical failure occurs during Task X, and it takes 2 hours to fix:
   New EFT(Task X) = Previous EFT(Task X) + 2 hours

8. Resource and Worker Optimization

   Balance the workload among workers and tools to minimize idle time and fatigue.

   Steps:

   - Reallocate tasks to underutilized workers.
   - Schedule breaks for workers to manage fatigue.
   - Optimize tool usage to avoid conflicts and delays.

   Example:

   - If Worker A is highly fatigued, reassign their next task to Worker B, who is less fatigued, to keep the process on schedule.

   Notify the selected candidate and end the process.

   Steps:
   - Identify the selected candidate.
   - Send notification to the selected candidate.
   - Mark the process as complete.

   Example:
   If Candidate 5 is selected, notify Candidate 5 and complete the process.


6. Total Process Duration
